To link your mobile application, sold via the Play Store, with Adapty, you'll need to generate special service account key files in the Google Play Console and then upload them to Adapty. These files ensure the security of your app, preventing unauthorized access.

1. Open the [**Service accounts**](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) section of the Google Play Console. Make sure you've chosen the correct project.

    alt="Manage keys action for the first service account" 
    style={{ width: '700px', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>





2. Locate the newly created service account in the list. Click the ellipsis button in the **Actions** column next to it, then select the **Manage keys** action.

    alt="Creating new key" 
    style={{ width: '700px', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>




3. In the opened window named after your project, click the **Add key** button, and in the opened drop-down list, select the **Create new key** option. 

   
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

    alt="Saving private key as a file" 
    style={{ width: '700px', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>




4. In the **Create private key for Your_project_name** window, click the **Create **button. This action will save your private key on your computer as a JSON file. You can use the name of the file provided in the opened **Private key saved to your computer** window to locate it if needed. 

   
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

    alt="Confirmation that your private key is saved" 
    style={{ width: '700px', border: '1px solid grey' }}
  />
</div>




The created file will be needed during the [initial integration of Adapty with Google Play](google-play-store-connection-configuration) step.
